# FlexMI – AI-Driven Adaptive EMI Platform

FlexMI is an AI-powered adaptive EMI platform that dynamically adjusts loan repayment schedules based on real-time cashflows, income patterns, and spending behavior. Unlike traditional fixed EMI systems, FlexMI adapts **when** payments are made—without changing loan contracts—reducing borrower stress and preventing loan defaults while remaining fully compliant with banking regulations.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Over 60% of borrowers struggle to pay EMIs due to job loss, high EMI-to-income ratios, and medical or family emergencies. Fixed EMI structures fail to account for fluctuating incomes, leading to borrower stress, defaults, and rising NPAs for banks.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
FlexMI introduces cashflow-aware EMIs that adapt repayment timing based on real-time affordability. The system distinguishes genuine financial stress from deliberate non-payment, enables automatic temporary relief during income shocks, and ensures transparency through explainable, consent-based decisions.
